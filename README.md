ArduinoPiano_gtgtc
==================
This project is for the 2014 Girls Teaching Girls To Code workshop in Hands-On Tinkering.  The code runs on an Arduino and
plays different notes on a capacitive-touch keyboard using a Piezo Buzzer. This starter version of the code assumes the
piano will have 5 keys.
